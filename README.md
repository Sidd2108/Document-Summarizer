# Document-Summarizer Using Python
### A Python-based project that allows users to upload a PDF document via a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit. Once uploaded, the application extracts the text content from the PDF and generates a concise summary. The summarization process employs NLTK, a natural language processing toolkit, to perform extractive summarization.
